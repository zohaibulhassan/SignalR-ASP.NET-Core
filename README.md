SignalR is a real-time web framework in ASP.NET Core that enables bi-directional communication between the server and connected clients. It allows the server to push content to connected clients instantly, and vice versa

 SignalR provides multiple transport mechanisms for communication, including WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), Long Polling, and more. It automatically chooses the best available transport based on the capabilities of the client and server.

 SignalR handles automatic reconnection in case of network interruptions, providing a more robust and reliable real-time communication experience.

 SignalR uses a hub-based model where clients can register methods on the server and invoke them remotely. This abstraction simplifies the development of real-time features.
